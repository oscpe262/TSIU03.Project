The user interacts with the system through a PS/2-connected keyboard. The keyboard is then handled by the module \verb?Keyboard? which reads the scan codes, matches these against a \emph{one hot encoded} preset which makes up the \verb?kb_input? signal passed to \verb?Vol_Bal?.

The module inputs are \verb=PS2_DAT=, \verb=PS2_CLK=, \verb=clk= and \verb=rstn= which are used to shift in the scan code and compare the result with the preset, resulting in \verb=kb_input= --- a 2-bit unsigned value indicating if either of the arrow keys have been released. \verb=Vol_Bal= will then use this signal to adjust the volume and balance level.
