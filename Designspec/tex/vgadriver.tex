The \verb+vga_drive+ module exists to handle the rendering of the image on the screen. 
The image that is supposed to be rendered consists of a background image previously 
stored in the SRAM consisting of pre filled bars that within the module will be blanked
out according to the input stimuli, which will give the apperence of bars beeing filled 
to different levels.   

The module itself consists of pipelined 11 sub modules (described below) 

  \subsection{VGA\_driver:bartender}
