%\emph{Challenges in the Design and Proposed Approach (Main 2 or 3 challenges and proposed solutions, 1/2 to 1 page per challenge).}

The major problem in the project is the merging of the different
modules together at top level. Most of the modules will be written and
debugged separately and only need minor adjustments before they have
been used in a bigger system.  This puts high pressure on this
document since a well thought through and described design hopefully
will result in pieces matching together.

A solution is to create and debug all modules and submodules
individually using test benches and waveforms to make sure the modules
work exactly as they are supposed to before putting them all together.

\section{Bar Graph Rendering}
\input{./tex/cha.barrend.tex} 

There are sveral different ways to render the bar graphs on the
screen but sience this application will use a pre defined background
this will be used to our advantage. Instead of manipulating the pixel
values in the areas covered by the bar-graphs to draw out the
bars the background image has the bars drawn out in the background
image, and the application simply blanks out from the top down, which
will give the apperence of bars (with gradients) being filled to
diffrent levels while only having to keep track of which pixels should
show the background and which that should be blanked out.
