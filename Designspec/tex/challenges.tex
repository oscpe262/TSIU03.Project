The major problem in the project is the merging of the different modules together
at top level. Most of the modules will be written and debugged separately and
only need minor adjustments before they have been used in a bigger system.
This puts high pressure on this document since a well thought through and described
design hopefully will result in pieces matching together.

A solution is to create and debug all modules and submodules individually
using test benches and waveforms to make sure the modules work exactly as
they are supposed to before putting them all together.
