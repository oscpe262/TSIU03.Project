Different approaches to making a function for a low pass filter will be considered.

The low pass filter will be a part of the \verb=Analysis= module since it will only be used to refine the displayed power levels. The respective bars rendered on the screen will be delayed by at least 100 ms in order to allow a satisfactory result of the filtering, since there s a need for future values and the filtering is done in real time.

Before implementation, time will be put aside to study and understand the problem further.
