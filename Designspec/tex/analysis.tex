The \verb=Analysis= module has one responsibility. It reads the ADC signal and puts out information on how to draw two bars (one for each speaker) that represent the amplitude of said signal. Since we want bars for before and after modulation, we'll use two instances of the same module. 

The required inputs include a left or right selection signal to specify which stereo channel we're about to analyse, two ADC signals (left and right), a clock signal that's synced with the \verb=VGA_driver= since the polling rate of the \verb=Snd_Driver= and \verb=Vga_Driver= differ.  

There are two output signals (once again, one left, one right). They determine the height of the bar which the \verb=VGA_Driver= should render. 

\verb=lrsel= determines which stereo channel should be read and thus which bar height should be written to at any given time.
