Project 41 is based around audio signal processing. The audio input and output both go through the WM8731 chip on a DE2 board and the hardware settings are controlled from a PS/2 keyboard and displayed on a VGA screen. The hardware settings to be implemented are a volume control and a balance control. In addition, an interface consisting of the input and output power level along with appropriate indicators as stated in the requirement specification.

In addition, the output sound should also be sent to a Class-D amplifier.
