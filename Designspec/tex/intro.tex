Project 41 is based around audio signal processing. The audio input and output both go through the WM8731 chip on a DE2 board. Meanwhile, the hardware settings are controlled from a PS/2 keyboard and displayed on a VGA screen. The hardware settings to be implemented are a volume control and a balance control. In addition, an interface consisting of the input and output power level along with appropriate indicators as stated in the requirement specification.

The WM8731 is a stereo codec, which in Project 41 is used as a bridge between the audio source and a class-D amplifier. The custom hardware controls the WM8731 as the analysis of the input controls and encoding the graphical output. The output sound sent to a Class-D amplifier is then allowed further amplification through another instance of pulse width modulation within the amplifier.
