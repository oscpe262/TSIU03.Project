There are several different ways to render the bar graphs on the screen. This project will use a pre-defined background. Instead of manipulating the pixel values in the areas covered by the bar graphs in order to draw out the bars, the background image has the bars predrawn, and the application blanks out from the top down, which will give the appearance of bars (with gradients) being filled to different levels while keeping track of which pixels should
show the background and which that should be blanked out.
