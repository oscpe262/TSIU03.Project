Foremost, the project has significantly increased my comprehension of digital circuit design. It has also shown that (which I am sure all of us already knew) that preparation is indeed key to success. Considering my fetish of documentation, I can not truthfully say that the sparse form of documentation has been a favourite of mine, but considering the given time frame, the intention with the project, and the fact that the course runs in parallel with TDDI02, I have to give it a pass. Over all, it has been a greatly enjoyable course.
