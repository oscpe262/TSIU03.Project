All things considered, the project was enlightening with many valuable lessons. Translating the design into our first prototype was quick and done with ease thanks to our design specification - thus emphasising the importance of preparation and good structuring.

Some specific knowledge learned: Modelsim is a powerful tool in resolving bugs and ensuring correct design implementation; word lengths and overflow are the sources of many problems; timing diagrams are very useful.

As for improving the course - we were advised to not use a certain state machine implementation shown in the lectures.
