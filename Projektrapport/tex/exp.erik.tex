As previous members have noted the design was very well thought
through and the implementation only differed in minor areas. My
biggest challenge was to operate the software, modelsim especially. I
probably should have payed more attention in the labs on how to
operate it cause getting it started and getting the test-bench working
took almost as long as the testing itself wich felt like a waste of time.
