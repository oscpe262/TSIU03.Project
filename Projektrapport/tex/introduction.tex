This is the final report treating the final project in the course
TSIU03 System design. The project was to design and implement a device
used for audio signal processing.

Using a DE2 board an external audio source can be connected via a
3.5 mm port, and accepts input for volume, balance and mute settings
via a PS/2 keyboard the signal is then processed by the application
and an image is rendered on a VGA-monitor displaying four signal level
bars representing the left and right channels both before and after
manipulation. There is also one bar displaying the current volume and
one bar displaying balance setting. There is also a symbol showing if
the system is muted.

This report covers all aspects of the work involved in the
project. It contains a brief system description, it lists the
major challenges and solutions to said challenges and personal
experiences from the group members involved.
