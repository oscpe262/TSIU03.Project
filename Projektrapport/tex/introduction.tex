This is the final report treating the final project in the course
TSIU03 System design. The project was to design and implement a device
used for audio signal processing. 

Using a DE2 board an external audio source can be connected via a
3.5mm port, the signal is then processed by the application and an
image is rendered on a vga screen displaying four signal level bars
representing the left and right channels both before and after
manipulation. There is also two bars displaying the current volume and
balance setting.

The application also accepts input via a ps/2 keyboard used for
setting volume
