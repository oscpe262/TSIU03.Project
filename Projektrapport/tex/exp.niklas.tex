With a well written design the conversion from text to VHDL went super smooth and was therefore very enjoyable. One thing I will take as a lesson is the fact that you should consider which different ways of implementing the same problem there is, consider the pros and cons of each way and from there on pick the most suitable one. 
I definitely had a good time working on this project.
