%	Our system can scale audio input both logarithmically for volume and linearly
%	for channel balance adjustment. The module responsible for these tasks is 
% 	the Vol_Bal module.
%	--- Most of you are familiar with the Sound Lab enviroment, and in comparison, 
%	our Vol_Bal assumes the logistic position of the Application module.
% 	--- Vol_Bal also stores the system level settings within its submodule
%	Current_Vol_Bal, which updates via the kb_input signal from the Keyboard module.

%	Now, on to the implementation.
%	
%	To start with, the Current_Vol_Bal module faces merely one challenge: 
%	When we update its registers, we need to stay on the legal range of values.
%	For volume, this is 0 to 10. For balance, -8 to 8. This is accomplished with
%	simple AND/OR logic. A '1' bit in the kb_input-vector only stays '1' if the relevant
%	system level is not already its legal max or min value. After that check, we update
%	accordingly.
%	--- These register outputs are then used for both the adjustments locally, and as
%	information for VGA_Driver so that the settings can be rendered on screen.

%	Moving on, Volume_Adjustment adjusts the LADC/RADC input, scaling it down
%	logarithmically in accordance with the formula below.
%	--- Every multiplication with the inverse square root of 2 results in a signal
%	reduction of approximately 3 dB. We do this n times where n is the volume level,
%	meaning we can change the audio signal on the range -30 to 0 dB.
%	--- To accomplish a varied amount of "multiplications", we use a state machine
%	that remains in an amplitude reduction state based on the value of system volume.
%	--- lrsel triggers the state machine and a "volume done" signal is forwarded when 
%	adjustment is complete.

%	Finally, the Balance_Adjustment submodule. Balance needs to perform linear
%	balance scaling according to THESE ***point at slide*** formulas.
%	The implementation of these does not require a state machine, but we need to
%	keep the current m value updated, based on our system balance level. A process
%	statement does this with ease, using lrsel as an aide and following the rules
%	in the listed functions.
%	--- The volume_done signal is used as a ready-signal for the adjusted audio input,
%	and the resulting output is sent back to SndDriver and to the post-processing Analysis 	%	module.

%	Now, X will talk about Y.
